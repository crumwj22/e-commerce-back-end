# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

This assignment is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

The user should clone the repository from GitHub and download Node. This application also requires Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Usage

Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
